## About The Project

![Othello gif](../assets/snake.gif)

Just a Snake game that runs in the cmd.

## Installation

1. Download the repository
2. Run the program by clicking on *Snake.exe*
> **If the screen is to big please change the console font size and restart the game.**     

## How To Play

Use the arrow keys to move. If you hit yourself or the wall it's game over. You get points by eating apples. However, every time you eat an apple your body gets longer, making the game more and more difficult.

### Controls

| Key	| Action	|
|:--|---|
| Arrow Keys | Change direction	|
